# IdeaOrganizer
This project was created and developed in combination with the course “individual project” at BTH. The goal was to get requirements from a costumer and to develop an app or a website accordingly. This project required me to develop an idea organization app that had the ability to store text, images, and audio recordings. The data had to be stored offline, meaning no external databases. As this was developed and released in a limited time window, some features might be missing, some bugs might persist and generally the app might not be the most optimized. Due to this, I highly recommend you NOT to view this as a reference-code for how a project in android studio should be structured but rather as an interpretation on how it could be.
